EthicAI Karma
Project Overview
An open-source moral behavior intelligence assessment system that provides dynamic karma value evaluation for daily user actions by integrating multiple large language model (LLM) APIs. Anyone can contribute code to improve the evaluation algorithms, collaboratively building a fairer moral judgment framework.

Core Features
🧠 ​​Multi-Model Support​​: Integrated with mainstream models including OpenAI, DeepSeek, and Qwen
📊 ​​Dynamic Weighting​​: Seven Virtues Evaluation Model trained on social news datasets
🛠️ ​​Developer-Friendly​​: Standardized API interfaces and SDKs
📈 ​​Visual Analytics​​: Generate moral behavior radar charts and historical trend analysis
🔒 ​​Privacy Protection​​: Supports local deployment with data encryption
